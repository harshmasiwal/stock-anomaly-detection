# Stock-Anomaly-Detection-using-ML-model

# Tech Stack:
 **Python, Quix, kafka, Redpanda, VS-Studio, Terminal, Docker.**

 # Overlook:

The project demonstrates the development of a robust anomaly detection system using data engineering and machine learning techniques. The  end-to-end system collects stock market data from an HTTP/FTP server, which is then processed in real-time using Quix Streams. With the help of Python an Isolation Forest model was developed and integrated into the end-to-end  pipeline to identify unusual patterns in the data for accurate anomaly detection. The system is designed for seamless deployment using Redpanda for efficient data streaming and Docker for containerization, ensuring portability and scalability. This project offers practical exposure to real-time data ingestion, transformation, and advanced machine learning workflows, providing a valuable solution for monitoring stock market anomalies.

# Workflow:
**Get the data -> Ingest the data using HTTP/FTP -> Use CLI for using Quix -> Run Docker -> Install Kafka -> Write transformation code in Python and use scikit-learn[Isolation Forest Model] -> collect the data in Redpanda**
